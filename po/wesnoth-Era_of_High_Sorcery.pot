msgid "), Wizards are powerful spellcasters, far beyond the abilities of normal units.\n\nAfter training in a spell realm, a wizard may cast spells via an item on the right-click menu. Casting a normal spell uses up your attack for the turn, but does not use up any movement points, so it is possible (and often desirable!) to move, cast a spell, and then move again after that.\n\nYou must always invoke the right-click menu at the target of your spell. For instance, to cast Energy Bolt at an enemy unit, you right-click on the enemy unit, pick the ''Cast a spell'' option, and select Energy Bolt from the list. If the spell's name appears in red, you can't cast it, but it gives details on what prevents you from casting it in that situation.\n\nSome spells are summoning spells that create other units for your army. Summoned creatures are always loyal, and half of the experience that any summoned creature earns goes to your leader instead. Your leader also earns the full experience for any units they kill directly with attack spells.\n\nYou can train your skills via another item on the right-click menu. You normally begin the game with 10 skill picks, and you gain 4 more whenever you level up (including AMLA) and 2 more whenever you, or your troops, kill an enemy wizard leader."
